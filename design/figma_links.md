# Figma Design Links

> **Purpose**: Track all Figma design files and export references for the app.

## Design Files

(No designs created yet - will be added in Phase 2)

---

## Export Conventions

- Export key screens as PNG or JPG
- Place in `/design/exports/[screen-name].png`
- Link to live Figma file here for reference
- Do NOT embed high-fidelity mockups in placeholder slices (behavior comes first)
