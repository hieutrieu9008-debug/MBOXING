# Slice 00 — Example Placeholder

## Intent
To demonstrate the "Phase 0" structure for brainstorming and exploration. This slice serves as a template for new ideas before they are fully specified.

## Open Questions
- What are the core user needs this slice addresses?
- Are there technical constraints we don't understand yet?
- Does this slice depend on other incomplete slices?

## Possible User Value
- Allows the team to capture ideas without committing to implementation details.
- Prevents "feature creep" by forcing clear intent before specification.

## UI Placeholder
(Text description only; no real UI decisions yet)
- A simple screen or component that allows the user to perform the core action.
- Likely needs a "Submit" button and a feedback mechanism.

## Behavior Placeholder
(High-level description, not rules)
- User enters data -> System validates -> Success message shown.

## Data Placeholder
(Conceptual entities only)
- `ExampleEntity` (id, name, status)

## Notes
- This is just a starting point. Once these questions are answered, copy the content to a new file and evolve it into a Phase 1 specification.
